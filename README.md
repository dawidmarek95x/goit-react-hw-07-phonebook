## Requirements
Refactoring the application code ([link](https://github.com/dawidmarek95x/goit-react-hw-06-phonebook)) so that the application works with the backend for saving contacts ([mockapi.io](https://mockapi.io/)). CreateAsyncThunk or RTK Query from the React Toolkit library had to be used to work with the backend and asynchronous queries.
